# Overview

This app is a daily planner and habit tracker. I created it for my own personal use. I know there are a million appls like this out there, but I wanted one that I could tailor precisely to my needs and tastse.

# Future Work

There is a lot of work left to do on this project. The biggest things are:

* Conenct to an external database so we can keep track of stats over time
